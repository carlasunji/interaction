  <!-- Compile a personal top 10 list. These should be ten things that inspire
  you, that you're interested in right now, or that make you want to be an artist/
  designer. It could have a theme, or no theme. It's a self-portrait in the form of
  a list. We'll use this as a way to introduce each other, and to get started coding.

  Once you have your list, make a webpage for your top 10. Your Top 10 webpage must
  include at least 10 tags.

  Use this as a chance to experiment with a variety of HTML tags, and to see what
  kind of layouts are possible with just HTML. -->
