  <div id="container">

    <div class="entry">
      <p class="carla">What do you miss most about living in Beirut?</p>
      <p class="nour">I miss walking on the street with people I know, I miss speaking Arabic, I miss unique people, I miss driving despite the commute being easy in Toronto. Having a car in Beirut and being able to go somewhere whenever I needed to is just easier.</p>
      <p class="nour">I miss specific places in Beirut, AUB [American University of Beirut], the sea. I miss my friends and family still in Beirut. I miss the comfort aspect of belonging in Beirut. I still feel like a tourist in Toronto like it is just temporarily mine.</p>

      <p class="nour">I miss the food and how you have trusted places when you need to buy meat [from the butcher] or fruits and vegetables [from a produce vendor] who you know and people to locate the meat, chicken, or fruits and vegetables.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
      <p class="carla">Who was part of your support system in Beirut?</p>
      <p class="nour">My parents, cousins, and close friends.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
      <p class="carla">How did Beirut feel like home to you?</p>
      <p class="nour">The entire city felt like home. It’s hard to explain.</p>
      <p class="nour">I was born there. Beirut itself is home.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
      <p class="carla">If you could ask someone from Beirut to move to Toronto, who would it be and why?</p>
      <p class="nour">I would ask my cousins Hicham and Amal to move to Toronto because having them here would complete me, and I speak to them everyday. I miss them the most.</p>
      <p class="nour">Amal always talks about wanting to come visit me. Hicham is studying in medical school and would come to Toronto eventually.</p>
